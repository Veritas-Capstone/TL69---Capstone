But that reasoning applies today, too: Despite months of government claims to the contrary, not everyone who wants, or should have, a test is getting one. Using data from Covid Tracking, STAT looked at the number of people tested and the number who tested positive for the disease (cases) in every state and Washington, D.C. We did that for three dates: in mid-May, mid-June, and mid-July. (Due to reporting anomalies, the dates selected sometimes differed by a day or two between states.)\n\nFor each date, we calculated the number of cases found per 1,000 tests \u2014 a measure of the disease\u2019s prevalence. For example, in Florida on May 13, that rate was 32. On June 13 it was 75. On July 13 it was 193. On May 13, Florida tested 15,159 people; on July 13, it tested 65,567.

Drinking ash of Phyllostachys nigra (black bamboo) mixed with honey and cow’s milk is a potent treatment for COVID-19.,"[""2.1.2 Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro Commonly known as \u201cblack bamboo\u201d, this is another major species in the genus Phyllostachys. Flavonoids extracted from black bamboo leaves have potent antioxidant activities (Hu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2002). Among these flavonoids, flavone c-glucosides and p-coumaric acid reportedly have long retention time in the colon and may contribute to free radical scavenging (Zhang et al., 2007). Luteolin 6-C-(6\u2033-O-trans-caffeoylglucoside), an antioxidant isolated from the leaves, has been reported to protect against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in retinal ganglion cells (Lee et al., 2010). It also enhances the activity of aldose reductase and inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products, and therefore may potentially have a role in the prevention of diabetic complications (Jung et al., 2007).\nOrientin, another antioxidant obtained from the leaves of black bamboo, exerts vaso-relaxant activity through the inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ influx (Fu et al., 2005). Orientin also prevents apoptosis induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation in myocardium and cardiomyocytes. The mechanism for this effect is inhibition of the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Fu et al., 2006). These studies suggest potential for cardio-protective effects.\n\nThe acetone fraction of the leaves of Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro has been shown to enhance leukemia cell differentiation (Kim et al., 2007b), and inhibit interleukin-12 (IL-12) production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages via decreasing NF-kappaB binding activity (Kim et al., 2007a).

Eleven species were found to use burrows, with six commensal species observed using burrows on numerous occasions. These included two mammal species (black-footed rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis pearsoni; brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata), three reptile species (peninsula dragon, Ctenophorus fionni; southern sand-skink, Liopholis multiscutata; White\u2019s skink, Liopholis whitii), and one avian species (little penguin, Eudyptula minor). \n\n\u201cThe most common species observed using burrows was the black-footed rock-wallaby, which was recorded using burrows 1795 times.\u201d"", ""Wombats definitely do not shepherd other animals into their burrows. It is possible that this idea arose because someone saw an animal either follow a wombat into its burrow, or the other animals went in first followed by the wombats.\n\n\u201cWombats generally are fairly tolerant of other animals. This may be because they have few real predators so they don't feel threatened by most animals, especially those that are small enough to fit in their burrows. They do interact with other animals on occasion.\u201d  Although unintentional, the refuge wombats provide for other animals has proved crucial in protecting them against raging bushfires. \n\nThe \u201cInterspecies co-use of southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows\u201d research paper states in part: \u201cBurrows can provide refuge for both burrowing and non-burrowing species within harsh environments through protection from climatic extremes, water loss and predation.\u201d""]",NOT ENOUGH INFO
